            <p><em>"Judy helped me to be positive with others even when my eating disorder pulled me into negativity. She created an atmosphere of hope and freedom. I couldn't have hoped for a better experience after so many failed attemps at other places."</em></p>
            <p>&mdash; L. G. </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <p><em>"I did not think there was a therapist out there that was ever going to fill my void of emotional support. I found that "perfect" support with Judy. It was an experience unlike any other and has been a key component to the success of my recovery today."
            </em></p>
            <p>&mdash; M. S.</p>
          </article>

          <article
            <p><em>"Judy Devries has helped me become a healthier person by asking the right questions. When I leave meetings with her, I always feel encouraged, challenged and I feel like I have tools to change my life. My sessions have affected my personal thought life, my relationships, and work life for the better."</em></p>
            <p>&mdash; M. J.</p>
          </article>

          <article
            <p><em>"Judy has helped me cope wwith a lot of issues I've been having over the years.  She is very direct and will tell me if I am wrong...which is something a good therapist should possess.  I love that she is that way and does not agree with things just to appease me.  I am and will continue to be a loyal client."</em></p>
            <p>&mdash; M. K.</p>
          </article>

          <article
            <p><em>"I cannot express enough how Judy has helped me over the years.  Her expertise and insight into my life, helping me manage difficult relationships as well as my own insecurities has been incredible.  No other therapist I have had in the past comes close to how much Judy has helped me grow and move past issues in my life.  Thank you Judy, - you are a blessing!"</em></p>
            <p>&mdash; N. A.</p>
          </article>

          <article
            <p><em>"I sought out Judy to help me initially understand how to manage my eating habits.  However, what has happened is my life has become more stable, enriched and clear.  She has helped me understand more about how things work and how I fit into life.  She has affirmed and challenged me time and again.  My life has forever been changed."</em></p>
            <p>&mdash; B. K.</p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <p><em>"I met Judy when I was in one of the lowest seasons of my life. I am someone who has been in and out of 30+ therapists offices and teatment programs in my lifetime and I was beginning to feel like I would never find someone who would actually help me. During my first session with Judy, I knew my time with her would be different to any other therapy experience I'd had up until that point. She is not afraid of thinking outside of the box in order to help me find freedom from depression, anxiety, OCD, and my eating disorder. Meeting with Judy is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I'll keep seeing her until she literally tells me to stop coming back!"</em></p>
